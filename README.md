# Neural Network Projects from Scratch

This repository contains two neural network projects implemented **entirely from scratch** using only **Python, NumPy, and Pandas**—no high-level frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch were used. The projects demonstrate fundamental concepts of neural networks, including forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent.

## 1. Titanic Survival Prediction
The first project uses the famous **Titanic dataset**, which contains information about passengers such as age, gender, class, and fare. The neural network predicts whether a passenger **survived or not**, providing hands-on experience with:

- Data preprocessing and handling missing values with Pandas
- Encoding categorical variables
- Designing and training a binary classification neural network
- Evaluating model performance with metrics like accuracy

## 2. Handwritten Digit Recognition
The second project works with a dataset of **handwritten digits (0–9)**. The neural network identifies which digit is represented by each input image, covering:

- Flattening image data for input into the network
- One-hot encoding for multi-class classification
- Implementing a multi-layer neural network with a softmax output
- Training and testing the model from scratch using only NumPy operations

Both projects aim to provide a **deep understanding of how neural networks function internally**, from raw mathematical operations to real-world predictions.
